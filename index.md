# Project Proposal
This is a project

## Overview
Maps currently available on the Internet like Google Maps, Bing Maps or Mapbox do not have a lot of detail about the terrain or land usage (farms, forests, type of vegetation, biomes, etc). They usually separate the areas in either urban (gray), rural/forests (green), or water (blue), like in the following image:

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/saimtiaz/cs639mapscan/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


### Test Section
This is a test.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/saimtiaz/cs639mapscan/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
